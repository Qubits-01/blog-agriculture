Future Ready ASEAN Front-end web development competition

Features
    We built this website to be RESPONSIVE in different screen sizes (ex. desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.).

    In making our website, we followed and combined different principles of fluent, modernism, and minimalism design movements
    so that the audience of our website can experience the outmost
    and out of this world visual pleasure.

Reminders
    In order to the see the true beauty of this static website, you     must have a decent INTERNET connection. The reasons for this are
    the following:

    1.1.    "Google Fonts" was used so that different browsers from
            various devices can experience the same website regardless if they have the required fonts in their system unit 
            or not.
    
    1.2.    "Font Awesome," a third party icon provider was used to             load the different visual icons in this website so that
            the source file of this project (website) will be much
            smaller.
    
    1.3.    "Slick Carousel" and "JQuerry" were also used to make the           beautiful post slider in the main menu possible. Special
            thanks to "ahmadalfy" from GitHub for inspiring us to
            incorporate this to our design.
